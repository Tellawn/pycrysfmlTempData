Epsilon Greedy with 
**1. SLOWER annealing epsilon
2. scaled reward (difference in chi squared divided chi squared)
3. optimizing chi-squared values
4. z-coordinate of the praseodymium atom parameterized.
5. Cutoff: (t > 10) and chi squared increases 3 times in a row
6. initial z for each simulation is randomized
